#### Calculation Details

The **Export Transfer Capacity Risk** value measure is calculated using the standard approach for all Risk Matrix Value. Inputs are user questionnaires and the Risk Matrix.

For both the baseline and the outcome values, risk is calculated as:
> **Risk** = Risk Consequence * Risk Probability

**Consequence**

The risk consequence is computed by determining the expected impact in MWh on exports and using the average price of exports.
 
| System Parameter      | Value       |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Cost of Export Energy | \$40.77/MWh |

> **Consequence** = Expected impact on exports (MWh) * Average Price of Exports ($40.77/MWh)

**Probability**

The probability is determined through the user questionnaire.

**Export Transfer Capacity Risk Value**

> **Export Transfer Capacity Risk** = Baseline Risk â€“ Outcome Risk
