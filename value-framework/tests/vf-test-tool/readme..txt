This folder contains some initial test files for Guy's VF Test Tool, in "model mode", based on the SampleCalcs sheet.

The following 2 models were tested:
- Environmental Benefit
- Cost Avoidance

Caveats:
- Safety Risk also appears in the SampleCalcs, but the sheet is incomplete so it can not be parsed yet.
- some "manual intervention" was needed for formulas 22 and 59
