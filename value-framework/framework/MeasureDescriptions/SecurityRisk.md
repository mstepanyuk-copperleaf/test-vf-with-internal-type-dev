#### Calculation Details

**Security Risk** is calculated in risk units using the standard approach for all Risk Matrix Value Measures:

> Risk = Consequence * Probability

By default, the system will assume that the risk is fully mitigated to a value of zero from the month following the last month of the Investment/Project with spend. This behaviour uses a default Automated Risk Mitigation questionnaire selection which has no user inputs.

If the user wishes to override this default behaviour and specify an outcome risk profile or a non-default impact date, they may use the Manual Risk questionnaire described above.

> Security Risk = Baseline Risk - Outcome Risk
