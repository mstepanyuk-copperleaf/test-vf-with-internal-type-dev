#### Calculation Details

> Asset effective age = 
>
> = Year - Asset In-Service Date

If the Asset In-Service Date field is not populated, the asset effective age is calculated based on the above formula, using the alternative start date as the input year. The use case being that an asset is being created on the alternative start date and its residual value is being calculated from this date onwards. 

Note that if the alternative start date is altered during optimisation the asset age and therefore residual value will modify accordingly.
