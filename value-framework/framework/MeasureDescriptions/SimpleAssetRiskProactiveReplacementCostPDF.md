#### Calculation Details

The Proactive Replacement Cost represents the expected value of a proactive replacement, adjusted for the probability that the asset survives until the given date. 

This is an Outcome-only Value Measure (no Baseline).

**Proactive Replacement Cost Consequence**

> = Asset Replacement Cost

**Probability of Asset Survival Until Impact Date**

> The Probability of Asset Survival Until Impact Date is calculated based on the cumulative probability of the asset survival until the impact date, based on the applicable Condition to Failure Curve, and the Baseline and Outcome Condition scores.

**Proactive Replacement Cost** 

> Proactive Replacement Cost = Probability of Asset Survival Until Impact Date * Proactive Replacement Cost Consequence
