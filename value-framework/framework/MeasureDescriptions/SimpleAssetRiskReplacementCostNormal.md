#### Calculation Details

This Value Measure calculates a Normalized Replacement Cost. It is intended to simulate an investment spend in the context of Program Analytics or Asset Analytics. It is not typically used in an Investment context.

The **Normalized Replacement Cost** is calculated as follows:

     Loaded Replacement Cost = 
         Replacement Cost * (1 + Cost Variation Factor)

   The **Loaded Replacement Cost** is then spread over time using a **Spend Profile Curve** (Asset Type), using the start time of the questionnaire.
