**Consequence**

> Consequence = (Business Continuity Employees Affected * Business Continuity Impact Level * Business Continuity Impact per Employee)

**Probability**

The Risk Probability is chosen manually from the guided user questionnaire.

**Business Continuity Risk** 

> Business Continuity Risk = Baseline Risk - Outcome Risk
