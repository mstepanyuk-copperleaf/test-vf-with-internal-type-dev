#### Calculation Details

The **M - Carbon Risk** measure is calculated using the standard approach for risk measures. It is calculated as follows:

> Carbon risk = 
>
> (Carbon Generated - Private (Tonnes CO2) + Carbon Generated - Company (Tonnes CO2)) * Non Traded Price of Carbon (per Tonnes CO2)

The value of the Carbon Risk measure is:

> **Carbon Risk** = Baseline Risk - Outcome Risk
