The value of the **Additional Costs - Financial Benefits** is calculated as:

Where LabourRate is a constant in the formula code, which may be different based on the account type (currently it is set to $110/hour for both CAPEX and OPEX account types).

The benefit value generated for the measure annually is equal to:
