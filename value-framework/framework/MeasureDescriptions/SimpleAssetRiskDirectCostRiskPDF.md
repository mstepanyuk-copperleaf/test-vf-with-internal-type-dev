#### Calculation Details

**Direct Cost Risk Consequence**

> Direct Cost Risk Consequence = 
>
> ReplacementCost * (1 + Cost Variation Factor) * (1 + Extra Damage Factor)

*NOTE: Some implementations include an additional multiplier (System Burden Multiplier). Currently this does not exist in the Base Library implementation.*

**Direct Cost Risk Probability of Event**

The baseline and outcome probabilities are calculated from the asset condition, and the applicable Condition to Failure Curve.

**Direct Cost Risk**

> **Direct Cost Risk** = Direct Cost Risk Probability of Event * Direct Cost Consequence
