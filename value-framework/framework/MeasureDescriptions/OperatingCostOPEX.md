#### Calculation Details

The **Investment/Project Cost - OMA** Value Measure is equal to the total monthly spend for the Investment/Project Alternative which has an Account Code whose Account Type is equal to the value of the OMA Account constant defined in the Value Framework.

This Value Measure is not intended to be used in the Value Function as it duplicates value already considered in the Investment/Project Cost Value Measure and is not converted to Value Units.

This Value Measure is intended for use as a portfolio optimization constraint and for reporting purposes.
