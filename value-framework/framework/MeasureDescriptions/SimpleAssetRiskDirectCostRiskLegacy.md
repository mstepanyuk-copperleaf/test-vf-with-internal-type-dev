#### Calculation Details

**Direct Cost Risk (Legacy) Consequence**

> Direct Cost Risk (Legacy) Consequence = 
>
> ReplacementCost * (1 + Cost Variation Factor) * (1 + Extra Damage Factor)

*NOTE: Some implementations include an additional multiplier (System Burden Multiplier). Currently this does not exist in the Base Library implementation.*

**Direct Cost Risk Probability of Event**

The likelihood calculation follows similar logic to Direct Cost Risk Probability of Event, but the calculation is modified to provide a result which is equivalent to the legacy Asset Analytics.

**Direct Cost Risk (Legacy)**

> **Direct Cost Risk (Legacy)** = Direct Cost Risk Probability of Event * Direct Cost Consequence
