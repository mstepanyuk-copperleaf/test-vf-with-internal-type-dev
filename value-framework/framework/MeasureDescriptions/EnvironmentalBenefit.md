#### Calculation Details

The value of the **Environmental Benefit** is calculated as:

> Environmental Benefit =
>
> (CO2 Reduction * ValuePerTonneCO2) + (SF6 Reduction * ValuePerKgSF6) +
> (Energy Savings * ValuePerMWPowerSavings) * Benefit Probability NTV

Where the following fields are configured as parameters in the Value Framework code: 

| Parameter Name         | Configured Value |
|------------------------|------------------|
| ValuePerTonneCO2       | $40              |
| ValuePerKgSF6          | $200             |
| ValuePerMWPowerSavings | $60              |

This Value Measure is calculated in dollars. It is intended for use in a Value Function and is converted to Value Units.
