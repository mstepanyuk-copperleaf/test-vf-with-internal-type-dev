The **Health and Safety Risk** value measure is calculated using the standard approach for risk measures. It is calculated as follows:

> Health and Safety risk =
>
> Health and safety risk (Minor injuries) + Health and safety risk (Major injuries) + Health and safety risk (Fatalities) + Health and safety risk (DSE injuries) + Health and safety risk (Other injuries) + Health and safety risk (Car accidents)

Health and Safety Risk is calculated for both the baseline and outcome case. The positive calue generated for the measure annualy is equal to:

> Risk = Baseline - Outcome
