#### Calculation Details

Customer Satisfaction Benefit is computed as:

> Customer Satisfaction Benefit = SURV * 50 * PROB / 100

Where:
- A gain of 1% of customers answering “satisfied” on the utility survey is valued at 50 points or $50K 
- SURV is the percentage improvement in customers answering “satisfied” on the next utility survey.
