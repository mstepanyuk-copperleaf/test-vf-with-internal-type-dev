#### Calculation Details

The **Construction Manager Hours** Value Measure is equal to the total monthly Resource Units for the Investment/Project Alternative with a Resource Code equal to the value of the CONSTRUCTION_MANAGER constant defined in the Value Framework.

This Value Measure is not intended to be used in the Value Function as it duplicates value already considered in the Investment/Project Cost Value Measure and is not converted to Value Units.

This Value Measure is intended for use as a portfolio optimization constraint and for reporting purposes.
