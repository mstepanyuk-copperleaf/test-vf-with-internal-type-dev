The **Emission Levels** Value Model measures the anticipated reduction in CO2 emissions for the Project being implemented as well as any fuel cost savings. If there is an increase in CO2 emissions or an increase in heat rate when the project is implemented, then a negative number should be input when asked for the outcome amount.

#### Value Model Inputs

The Emission Levels Value Model takes inputs from a user questionnaire, a system Configurable Field value, and operating unit Configurable Fields values.

#### Value Model Outputs

The Emission Levels Value Model outputs four Value Measures:
- Emission Levels
- Emission Levels - KPI
- CO2 Intenstity Reduction
- Fuel Cost Savings
